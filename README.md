# Note Book

## Introduction

_Note Book_ is a web application for those who like to read a lot and take a lot of notes. Instead of having to skim through the pages of notepads or the books themselves to find that one quotation that you marked _somewhere_, Note Book allows you to add all your book to a digital collection, take as many notes and quotes for each book as you like and keeping them all in one place.
_A filter function will be implemented soon!_

## Features

- Sign up for a free user account
- Add all your book to your personal digital collection
- Access all notes & quotations you took for each book
- _Soon: a filter option for categories and keywords to control which notes are displayed_

## Installation

After cloning this repository from Github, use the terminal to cd into the cloned parent folder, then run `npm install` inside **both** the /frontend and /backend folders.

Create a new MySQL database and import the **note-book.sql** file (or copy & paste its content into the new database manually) in order to have the required tables.

In the /backend folder, rename the **.env.sample** file to just **.env** and replace the placeholder values inside with your actual MySQL data and credentials.

Lastly, run `npm start`, again in both the /frontend and /backend folders and keep both terminal tabs/windows open and running all the time.
